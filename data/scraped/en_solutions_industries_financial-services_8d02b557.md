Financial Services
## Sovereignity is the backbone of the Swiss financial sector
The journey to the cloud offers unparalleled opportunities for efficiency, scalability, and innovation. However, it comes with a unique set of challenges, from ensuring the utmost security of sensitive financial data to navigating complex regulatory landscapes. Phoenix helps organizations mitigate risk and accelerate financial service cloud adoption for even their most sensitive workloads.

## Trends and Requirements
Regulatory trends in Switzerland’s financial sector are focused on anti-money laundering (AML), regulation of currencies, sustainable finance, data protection, and privacy. New binding requirements, aligned with EU regulations, aim to enhance transparency through non-financial reporting and tackle climate-related risks. There's also an emphasis on preventing greenwashing and ensuring genuine sustainability in financial practices. The forthcoming rules highlight the need for a coordinated approach to manage regulatory complexity.
