## Key Features
#### Create your own Agents
Cut costs, achieve superior results, and gain unparalleled customization by building your own AI agents—because no one understands your business needs better than you. With our team of AI experts and intuitive tools, you can effortlessly integrate your agents with existing systems, ensuring seamless scalability and maximum ROI.
#### Highest Security
The AI system ensures robust security with AES-256 encryption, post-quantum cryptography, and immutable blockchain-based server attestations, embedding protection directly into its architecture to safeguard data and maintain system integrity. Its secure pipeline uses single-use enclaves for computations and an air-gapped design to prevent data leakage, tampering, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks while ensuring compliance and operational resilience.
#### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
Our Sovereign AI Solution allows you to use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), thus ensures complete data isolation, preventing any information leakage within the system. This guarantees that your data remains secure and separated, providing tailored, accurate responses without compromising privacy.
#### IBM VELA AI Supercomputer
The platform’s computational backbone is the IBM Vela AI Supercomputer, featuring over 860 H100 GPUs and AIUs. This infrastructure delivers the performance needed for rapid model training and deployment, allowing businesses to scale and innovate efficiently. A Modern Container Platform further enhances adaptability by supporting containerized workloads across diverse chip architectures, making it a versatile solution for evolving technological needs.
### "AI Agents are transforming industries with scalable, secure, and high-quality experiences. Powerful AI models and seamless integrations make it a top choice for businesses aiming to reduce costs and complexity to enhance employee productivity, and drive operational efficiency."
