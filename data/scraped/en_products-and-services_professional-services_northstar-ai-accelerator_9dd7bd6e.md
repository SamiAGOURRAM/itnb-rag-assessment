## The pressure to integrate AI with lack of a clear, aligned Strategy
Many organizations feel pressured to “integrate AI” without a clear, aligned strategy, leading to confusion, fear, and false starts. While AI is advancing rapidly, leadership decisions often lag behind, creating a disconnect between strategy, risk, and execution. Ethical concerns, cybersecurity, and data sovereignty are frequently treated as afterthoughts. Internal proof of concepts tend to stall due to a lack of a solid business case or clear roadmap, making it difficult to overcome the key obstacles and accelerate progress.
