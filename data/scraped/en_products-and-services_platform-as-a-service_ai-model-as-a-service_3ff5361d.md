## What is AI Model as a Service
Deploying AI models in-house usually requires significant resources, expertise, and infrastructure. With AI Model as a Service, businesses can instantly integrate AI/ML capabilities into their applications via a cloud-based API—without the burden of building, training, or managing models themselves. 
Whether you choose Model-as-a-Service for instant deployment or Bring Your Own Model on dedicated GPUs, our confidential computing environment ensures top-tier security and compliance. Scale effortlessly, reduce costs, and focus on innovation while we handle the complexities of AI infrastructure.
