## Reduce CO2 Emissions
While cloud computing offers significant environmental benefits, it's essential for organizations to adopt sustainable practices when using cloud services. This includes optimizing resource usage, implementing efficient software architectures, and regularly monitoring and optimizing cloud resources to prevent overprovisioning.

## How you can reduce CO2 Emissions with Phoenix
We use advanced technologies in our data centers, such as server virtualization and energy-efficient cooling systems, to reduce energy consumption compared to many on-premises data centers. Consolidating workloads in the cloud can lead to significant energy savings.
#### Scaling and Right-Sizing
As a Cloud Provider, we allow organizations to scale their computing resources up or down based on demand. This elasticity enables efficient resource allocation, eliminating the need to maintain idle servers, which can be a source of energy waste in traditional data centers.
#### Renewable Energy Usage
Our partner, Green Datacenter AG, reduces the carbon footprint by sourcing electricity from renewable energy sources for data center facilities, cooling, and operations. In addition, photovoltaic systems also contribute to climate-friendly power generation.
#### Server Efficiency
We use the latest technologies and upgrade our server hardware regularly to take advantage of energy-efficient technologies. This ensures that the infrastructure supporting cloud services remains efficient over time.
#### Multi-Tenancy
Cloud computing promotes multi-tenancy, where multiple customers share the same physical infrastructure. This sharing reduces the overall number of servers and hardware components required to support computing workloads, resulting in energy savings.
#### Reduced Waste Heat
The Zurich Metro Campus is developing a heating network capable of providing heat for over 3,500 households and delivering process heat to nearby businesses. This district heating initiative has the potential to replace numerous fossil-fuel-based heating systems, resulting in an annual reduction of approximately 20,000 tons of CO2 emissions.
### IBM Linux One
IBM LinuxONE technology significantly reduces CO₂ emissions by consolidating workloads onto a smaller number of highly efficient servers, minimizing the energy needed for compute and cooling. Its advanced virtualization capabilities allow for extremely high utilization rates, reducing the hardware footprint compared to traditional x86 environments. Combined with optimized power consumption and sustainable design, LinuxONE enables organizations to lower their carbon impact without compromising performance.
