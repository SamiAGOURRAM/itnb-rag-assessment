## Data Processing Agreement
### Preamble and Relationship to Terms of Service
This Data Processing Agreement ("DPA") forms part of and is subject to the Phoenix Terms of Service ("ToS") and any applicable Order Form or Statement of Work between Phoenix Technologies AG ("Phoenix", "Processor") and the customer identified in the applicable Order Form or SOW ("Customer", "Controller"). Capitalised terms used but not defined herein have the meanings in the ToS or, if not defined there, the meanings set out in the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (nFADP) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to the extent applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, the order of precedence stated in the ToS applies: this DPA governs the Parties’ respective data-protection obligations for the Services; the ToS governs all other matters (including fees, scope of Services, limitations of liability, and governing law). 
For the purpose of this DPA, “Data Protection Laws” means any applicable privacy and data protection laws, including (i) the South African Protection of Personal Information Act, No. 4 of 2013, (“POPIA”) as may be amended from time to time; (ii) to the extent that it may be applicable, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”); (iii) to the extent that it may be applicable, United Arab Emirates Federal Decree Law No. 2 of 2019 Concerning the Use of the Information and Communication Technology in the Area of Health (“ICT Health Law”) and United Arab Emirates Federal Decree Law No. 45 of 2021 Regarding the Personal Data Protection; (iv) UK Data Protection Act 2018; (v) Swiss Federal Data Protection Act 2020; and (vi) any other laws, regulations and secondary legislation enacted from time to time in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Namibia, Switzerland or the United Arab Emirates or any other country applicable to Customer relating to data protection, the use of information relating to individuals, the information rights of individuals and/or the processing of personal data.
### 1. Subject Matter, Purpose, and Duration
1.1 Subject & Purpose. Phoenix will process Personal Data solely to provide, secure, and support the Services as described in the ToS and the applicable Order Form, and strictly in accordance with Customer’s documented instructions (as further described in Section 3).
1.2 Duration. Processing under this DPA continues for the subscription term (including any renewals) and for a reasonable period thereafter to effect return or deletion under Section 7 and comply with legal obligations.
### 2. Categories of Personal Data and Data Subjects
2.1 Categories. The types of Personal Data processed depend on Customer’s use of the Services and may include identifiers (e.g., names, business emails), account and usage data, support communications, prompts/inputs, and model outputs where such data relate to an identified or identifiable natural person.
2.2 Data Subjects. Data subjects may include Customer’s employees, contractors, consultants, and end users.
2.3 Special Categories. Customer will not submit special categories of Personal Data (e.g., health, biometric, or government ID numbers) unless expressly permitted in an Order Form and governed by the DPA and applicable Data Protection Laws.
### 3. Documented Instructions and Processing Restrictions
3.1 Instructions. Phoenix shall process Personal Data only on documented, lawful instructions from Customer, including those set out in the ToS, applicable Order Forms, and this DPA. If Phoenix is required by applicable Data Protection Laws to process Personal Data beyond Customer’s instructions, Phoenix will (where legally permitted) inform Customer before such processing.
3.2 Training & Product Improvement. Unless expressly agreed in writing (e.g., via a Sub‑Annex), Phoenix will not use Customer Content, including Personal Data, to train, fine‑tune, or otherwise improve models for the benefit of Phoenix or third parties.
3.3 No Independent Determination. Phoenix will not determine the purposes or means of processing and will not combine Customer Personal Data with data obtained from other customers except as necessary for the provision and security of the Services.
### 4. Confidentiality and Personnel
4.1 Confidentiality. Phoenix will ensure that persons authorised to process Personal Data are bound by appropriate confidentiality obligations and receive data protection training appropriate to their roles.
4.2 Access Control. Access to Personal Data is role‑based and limited to the minimum necessary to perform the Services.
4.3 Phoenix may update organizational measures without Customer consent, provided overall protection is not reduced.
### 5. Security Measures
5.1 ISMS & Controls. Phoenix maintains an ISO 27001‑aligned information security management system (ISMS) and implements technical and organisational measures (TOMs) appropriate to the risk, including encryption in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES‑256), logical separation, access controls, logging, and monitoring. Where selected by Customer, Phoenix provides confidential computing capabilities to protect data in use within attested enclaves and supports client‑controlled key management (BYOK/KYOK).
5.2 Evolution. Phoenix may update TOMs to maintain or improve security; such changes will not materially diminish the overall level of protection.
5.3 Reference to ToS. Additional security details and operational commitments are set out in the ToS and the Security Documentation referenced therein.
### 6. Sub‑Processors
6.1 Authorisation. Customer grants Phoenix a general written authorisation to engage sub‑processors to support the Services. Phoenix will impose data‑protection obligations on sub‑processors that are no less protective than those set out in this DPA.
6.2 Notice & Objection. Phoenix will notify Customer of material changes to its sub‑processor list immediately. Customer may object on reasonable, data‑protection grounds within twenty (20) calendar days of notice. If no mutually acceptable solution is found, Customer may terminate the affected Service; Phoenix may offer alternatives where feasible.
6.3 Responsibility. Phoenix remains responsible for sub‑processors’ performance to the extent they process Personal Data for Phoenix.
6.4 Current Status. Phoenix confirms that, as of the Effective Date of this DPA, it does not engage any sub processors in connection with the Services.
### 7. Return or Erasure of Personal Data
7.1 No Unilateral Deletion. Phoenix does not initiate unilateral erasure of Customer Personal Data in the ordinary course.
7.2 Return/Deletion on Exit. Upon request or termination/expiry of the applicable Services, Phoenix will, at Customer’s choice and subject to applicable Data Protection Laws, either return Personal Data to Customer or securely delete it. Phoenix will provide confirmation of deletion on request. Where continued retention is required by law, Phoenix will isolate and protect the data from further processing. 
7.3 Retention Schedules & Secure Disposal. Phoenix adheres to documented retention and disposal schedules consistent with legal, regulatory, and business requirements. Records reaching the end of their retention period are disposed of using secure methods to ensure irretrievable destruction.
7.4 Flexibility. Phoenix will consider reasonable, client‑specific retention or disposal requirements documented in an Order Form or Sub‑Annex.
7.5 Order Form Specifications. Any specifications, instructions, or requirements mandated by the Customer that go beyond the general provisions of this DPA shall be recorded in the applicable Order Form (or Sub Annex, where appropriate) and shall form an integral part of this DPA.
### 8. Data Subject Requests
8.1 Assistance. Taking into account the nature of the processing, Phoenix will assist Customer by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as possible, to fulfil Customer’s obligation to respond to requests to exercise Data Subject rights under applicable Data Protection Laws.
8.2 Routing. If Phoenix receives a request directly from a Data Subject and can identify the relevant Customer, Phoenix will forward the request to Customer without undue delay and will not respond to the request except on documented instructions from Customer or as required by law.
### 9. Security Incidents
9.1 Notification. Phoenix will notify Customer without undue delay upon becoming aware of a Personal Data Breach affecting Customer Personal Data, providing information available at the time to assist Customer in meeting its reporting obligations. Phoenix will provide updates as more information becomes available.
9.2 Mitigation. Phoenix will promptly take reasonable steps to contain, investigate, and remediate the incident.
### 10. International Processing and Data Transfers
10.1 Switzerland‑Only. All processing of Customer Personal Data under this DPA occurs exclusively in Switzerland. Phoenix does not transfer Customer Personal Data outside Switzerland without prior written agreement.
10.2 Safeguards if Enabled. If the Parties later agree to processing outside Switzerland, Phoenix will implement appropriate transfer safeguards such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to the extent applicable) adapted for Switzerland and any required supplementary measures. If Customer initiates transfer outside Switzerland, Phoenix is indemnified for any resulting compliance failures.
### 11. DPIA, Records, and Regulatory Cooperation
11.1 DPIA Support. Phoenix’s processes and controls align to GDPR and ISO 27001. Phoenix will provide reasonable assistance to Customer with Data Protection Impact Assessments and prior consultations with supervisory authorities, insofar as they relate to Phoenix’s processing, within reasonable resource and operational limits, and in compliance with applicable Data Protection Laws.
11.2 Records. Each Party is responsible for maintaining records of processing activities required by law for its respective role.
11.3 Cooperation. Phoenix will cooperate with competent supervisory authorities, upon lawful request, in relation to the Services.
### 12. Audits and Information
12.1 Reports & Certifications. Upon request and subject to confidentiality, Phoenix will make available information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA, which may include ISO 27001 certificates or third‑party assessment summaries.
12.2 Audit. Where such documentation is insufficient, Customer may conduct an on‑site or remote audit of Phoenix’s processing of Customer Personal Data no more than once per twelve (12) months, or more frequently following a material Personal Data Breach, subject to reasonable notice, scope, and security requirements. Audits must not unreasonably disrupt operations and may not be performed by a direct competitor. Each Party bears its own costs; Phoenix may charge reasonable fees for support beyond standard assistance.
### 13. Sub‑Annexes and Tailored Provisions
13.1 Sub‑Annexes. Client‑specific terms (e.g., bespoke retention, additional redaction, telemetry sinks, or transfer mechanisms) may be documented in Sub‑Annexes. Where a Sub‑Annex conflicts with this DPA, the most recent Sub‑Annex prevails for the conflicting subject matter.
### 14. Liability; Order of Precedence
14.1 Liability. The liability limitations and exclusions in the ToS apply to this DPA and all processing performed hereunder. This DPA does not expand Phoenix’s liability beyond that stated in the ToS.
14.2 Precedence. For data‑protection subject matter, this DPA prevails over the ToS to the extent of any direct conflict. For all other matters, the ToS governs.
### 15. Governing Law, Venue
15.1 Governing Law. This DPA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of Switzerland (to the exclusion of the conflict of law principles).
15.2 Venue. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this DPA shall exclusively be referred to the courts competent for Basel‑Stadt, Switzerland.
