## Run Critical Applications
Mission-critical workloads encompass essential IT applications directly tied to an organization's core functions. Examples include financial transaction systems, customer-facing applications, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. These systems are vital for seamless operations, financial integrity, and customer satisfaction, making their reliability of utmost importance.

## Challenges of Critical Workloads
#### Revenue loss due to halted transactions or inaccessible services
Mission-critical workloads face the constant threat of revenue loss when transactions are halted, or services become inaccessible. These disruptions can result in significant financial setbacks, making uninterrupted operations vital for financial stability.
#### Damage to the organization's reputation and customer trust
Additionally, mission-critical processes are closely tied to an organization's reputation and customer trust. Any compromise in these operations can tarnish the organization's image, leading to a loss of trust from customers and stakeholders.
#### Regulatory non-compliance, leading to penalties or legal issues
Ensuring compliance with regulations is paramount within mission-critical operations. Regulatory non-compliance can result in penalties and legal complications, emphasizing the need for meticulous adherence to established rules and standards.
#### Disruptions to supply chain or manufacturing processes
Supply chain and manufacturing disruptions have a domino effect on mission-critical workflows, causing delays and inefficiencies that can harm an organization's overall performance.
#### Decreased productivity and increased operational costs
Mission-critical workloads are susceptible to decreased productivity, often accompanied by increased operational costs. Balancing productivity and cost-effectiveness is crucial to maintaining the health and sustainability of these essential processes.
#### Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
Maintaining business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities is a challenge. Organizations must ensure that data and services remain accessible and recoverable during and after the transition.
