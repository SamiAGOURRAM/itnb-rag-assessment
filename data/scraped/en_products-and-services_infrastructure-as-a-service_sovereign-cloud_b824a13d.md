## What is Sovereign Cloud
Our Infrastructure as a Service is a sovereign Swiss cloud platform offering availability, reliability, scalability, and security. With zones in Zurich and Basel, it guarantees 99.99% uptime and ensures regulatory compliance. Our infrastructure services include CPU and GPU compute, storage, networking, databases, virtual machines (VMs), virtual private clouds (VPCs), single sign-on (SSO), code and secret management, Kubernetes, and native integration with Red Hat OpenShift and OpenShift AI.
## Key Features
#### Confidential Computing
Protect your most sensitive data with hardware-based encryption that keeps it secure at rest, in transit and even during processing. Our confidential computing environment ensures end-to-end privacy, regulatory compliance, and uncompromised performance — enabling you to run AI and cloud workloads with complete trust.
#### Cost Effectiveness
Our Infrastructure-as-a-Service offering maximizes cost efficiency through intelligent automation, elastic scalability, and streamlined operations — while leveraging open-source software to reduce licensing overhead. By avoiding overprovisioning and eliminating hidden fees, we deliver transparent, predictable pricing without compromising performance.
#### Certifications and Compliance
While our intellectual property is vital, we believe transparency and certified processes boost data security, confidentiality, and trust in our ecosystem.
#### No Vendor Lock-In
Our Swiss-based, open-source infrastructure ensures full control over data, backups, and workloads—free from foreign reliance.
